# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 :
import numpy as np
### Step 2:
we have created a matrix using array and we will find 3
### Step 3: 
We can find the inverse of the martix by using np.linalg.inv and passing the matrix.
### Step 4: 
Finally, print the value of the inverse of the matrix.
## Program:
'''
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: Harshini Y
#RegisterNumber:212223240050
import numpy as np
A=[[2,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,-1,2]]
B=np.linalg.inv(A)
print(B)
'''
## Output:
